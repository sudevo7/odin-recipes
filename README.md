# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website built as part of The Odin Project's HTML course. The website contains multiple recipe pages, each with a description, ingredients, and instructions for making different dishes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice creating basic HTML structure and linking between pages. The website includes:
- A home page (`index.html`) with links to individual recipe pages.
- Several recipe pages (e.g., `spaghetticarbonara.html`, `tacopizza.html`, `wetburrito.html`) with:
  - A title of the recipe
  - An image of the finished dish
  - A description of the recipe
  - A list of ingredients
  - Step-by-step instructions for making the dish.

## Features
- Links between pages for easy navigation.
- Recipe pages with relevant content, including ingredients and instructions.
- A simple and clean design focused on learning HTML and structuring a website.
