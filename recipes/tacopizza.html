    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I was looking for a recipe for a taco pizza, but couldn't find exactly the
      kind I was wanting so I decide to wing it and came up with this one
      myself. The results were great. My husband said it was the best one he'd
      ever had! For an extra treat, top with lettuce, tomato and sour cream.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>10 fluid ounces warm water</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>¾ cup water</li>
      <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) can fat-free refried beans</li>
      <li>⅓ cup salsa</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
      <li>4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add water, salt, oil, flour and yeast to your bread machine in the order
        listed. Select the dough cycle. Check dough after it has been mixing for
        a few minutes. If it is too dry and not mixing, add water, 1 tablespoon
        at a time, until it is mixing and has a nice dough consistency. You want
        the dough to be pliable but not sticky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine tomato paste, water, and 3/4 of the
        package of taco seasoning mix. Stir in chili powder and cayenne pepper;
        set aside. In another bowl, mix refried beans, salsa, and onion; set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until evenly brown;
        drain excess fat. Season with the remaining 1/4 package of taco
        seasoning and a small amount of water. Simmer for a few minutes, then
        remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        When the dough cycle is finished, remove dough from the machine. Divide
        dough in half, and pat into two 12-inch pans. Spread a layer of bean
        mixture on top of dough, then a layer of the tomato mixture. Sprinkle
        with seasoned beef and top with Cheddar cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted,
        about 15 minutes, turning pizzas halfway through baking.
      </li>
    </ol>
